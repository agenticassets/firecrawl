# create-command

Design and generate a new Cursor AI slash command tailored to specific research, analytical, or workflow needs.

## Command Development Process

### Step 1: Requirements Analysis
Analyze the specified task or process to understand:
- **Primary objective**: What specific problem does this command solve?
- **User context**: Academic, professional, or technical domain requirements
- **Input expectations**: What information will users typically provide?
- **Output requirements**: What deliverables should be produced?
- **Quality standards**: What level of rigor and documentation is needed?

### Step 2: Command Architecture
Design the command structure with:
- **Clear naming**: Descriptive, hyphenated command name following conventions
- **Logical organization**: Well-structured sections with appropriate headers
- **Process flow**: Sequential steps or parallel activities as appropriate
- **Integration points**: How the command fits into broader workflows
- **Error handling**: Anticipate common issues and provide guidance

### Step 3: Implementation Specifications
Create comprehensive command including:
- **Opening statement**: Brief, clear description of command purpose
- **Process methodology**: Step-by-step instructions with academic rigor
- **Output formats**: Specific deliverable requirements with examples
- **Quality assurance**: Validation steps and success criteria
- **Usage examples**: Typical use cases and parameter options

### Step 4: Academic Integration
Ensure the command meets scholarly standards:
- **Methodological rigor**: Appropriate analytical approaches for the domain
- **Citation standards**: Proper reference formats and academic conventions  
- **Reproducibility**: Code and analysis documentation requirements
- **Publication quality**: Output suitable for academic or professional use

## Deliverable Requirements
Generate a complete `.md` file with:
- Proper Cursor AI command format
- Clear, actionable instructions under 150 lines
- Academic rigor appropriate for research contexts
- Integration with existing workflow and tools
- Quality assurance checkpoints and validation steps
- Save the command in this folder @.cursor\commands

Create a new Cursor AI slash command for the specified task or process:
