# refine-code

Expert codebase review and improvement analysis. You are an expert codebase engineer, designer, and architect specializing in deep code analysis and optimal refinement recommendations.

## Review Process

### Step 1: Code Analysis
Examine the specified code section with architectural expertise:
- **Structure assessment**: Evaluate code organization, patterns, and architecture
- **Design evaluation**: Review component design, data flow, and integration points
- **Quality analysis**: Assess code quality, maintainability, and best practices
- **Context understanding**: Consider surrounding codebase, dependencies, and project standards

### Step 2: Deep Analysis
Think critically about the code:
- **Pattern evaluation**: Identify design patterns, anti-patterns, and architectural decisions
- **Performance considerations**: Assess efficiency, scalability, and optimization opportunities
- **Maintainability review**: Evaluate readability, documentation, and future extensibility
- **Standards compliance**: Check alignment with project conventions and industry best practices

### Step 3: Optimal Recommendations
Provide targeted improvement suggestions:
- **Minor refinements**: Small improvements, code style adjustments, or micro-optimizations
- **Significant changes**: Architectural improvements, refactoring opportunities, or design enhancements
- **No changes**: If code is optimal, clearly state no recommendations are needed
- **Priority guidance**: Indicate which changes provide the most value

## Output Format

Provide a structured analysis with:
- **Summary**: Brief assessment of code quality and overall state
- **Recommendations**: Specific, actionable suggestions organized by priority
- **Rationale**: Clear explanation of why each recommendation improves the codebase
- **Impact**: Expected benefit of implementing suggested changes

## Usage Examples

- `/review-and-refine components/message.tsx` - Review message component architecture
- `/review-and-refine lib/ai/providers.ts` - Analyze AI provider configuration patterns
- `/review-and-refine app/(chat)/api/chat/route.ts` - Evaluate chat API route implementation

Review code sections to identify optimal improvements and refinements.
