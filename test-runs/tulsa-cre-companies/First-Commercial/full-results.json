Therefore, we do not up-charge any of our services and do not tack on any additional fees, such as trip charges, etc.\n\nAll of our charges are clearly identified before a contract is signed. FCMM does not own any part of the third-party contractors that we use nor do we receive any “kick-backs”, commissions or incentive fees for using these companies. \n\nWe attach all invoices to work orders so the Client sees exactly what the expenses are.  We pay all bills weekly, , making reports very consistent and as true to monthly costs as possible. We provide full financial reports to the Owners or Associations every month and a summary page that breaks down the month financially.  We also provide a monthly management report that identifies all of the activities performed on the property by our management and maintenance staff, as well as recommendations for going forward. \n\n*   Board meeting notifications\n*   Preparation of board meeting agendas\n*   Proprietary board meeting software\n*   CPA on staff\n\n*   Preparation of board minutes and motion sheets\n*   Board member documents provided online\n*   Construction management for renovations\n*   Board room for Association use\n\nkeep in  \ntouch\n---------------\n\nFirst Commercial Companies\n--------------------------\n\n8316 E 73rd St, Tulsa, OK 74133\n\nsend us an email\n\n*   [Brokerage: brokerage@first-commercial.com](mailto:melanier@first-commercial.com)\n    \n\n*   [Apartment Management: management@first-commercial.com](mailto:management@first-commercial.com)\n    \n\n*   [Association Management: hoa@first-commercial.com](mailto:ginas@first-commercial.com)\n    \n\n*   [Home \u0026 Condo Management: units@first-commercial.com](mailto:ginas@first-commercial.com)\n    \n\nCall Now\n\n*   [Brokerage:  \\\n    (918) 495-1551](tel:(918)%20495-1551)\n    \n\n*   [Apartment Management:  \\\n    (918) 921-1677](tel:(918)%20921-1677)\n    \n\n*   [Association Management:  \\\n    (918) 481-8882](tel:(918)%20481-8882)\n    \n\n*   [Home \u0026 Condo Management:  \\\n    (918) 481-8882](tel:(918)%20481-8882)\n    \n\nFollow us\n\nFacebook-f Twitter Linkedin-in Youtube\n\n![](https://first-commercial.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/FCREM-logo-1-2048x683.png)\n\n[Facebook-f](https://www.facebook.com/First-Commercial-Real-Estate-Services-Corporation-536252246489246/timeline/) [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/firstcommercialcompanies/) [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FirstCRE) [Linkedin-in](https://www.linkedin.com/company/first-commercial-real-estate-services-corporation) [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfCD2nhcR0QIA3AcsNH_YiQ)\n\n© 2020-2025.

Whether you’re heading out of town for a weekend or spending several weeks away, a little preparation goes a long way in keeping your home safe and giving you peace of mind.\n\nAt **First Commercial Real Estate \u0026 Management**, your comfort and security matter to us. Here are our top tips to help ensure your apartment stays safe while you enjoy your holiday travels\n\n### **Double-Check Doors, Windows \u0026 Locks**\n\nBefore you leave, take a few minutes to do a walk-through:\n\n*   Ensure all windows are fully closed and locked\n    \n*   Test your front-door lock and deadbolt\n    \n*   Remove spare keys stored outside—thieves know the common hiding spots\n    \n*   If you have a patio or balcony door, secure it with the provided locking bar or rod\n    \n\nA quick security sweep can eliminate many potential risks.\n\n* * *\n\n### **Use Smart Lighting or Timers**\n\nA dark, quiet apartment for several days can signal that no one is home. To help your home look lived-in:\n\n*   Set a few lamps on timers\n    \n*   Use smart bulbs or plugs to automate lighting\n    \n*   Leave blinds or curtains in their usual positions\n    \n\nConsistency is key—don’t make sudden changes right before leaving.\n\n* * *\n\n### **Unplug Nonessential Electronics**\n\nBeyond security, safety matters too. Reduce fire risk and save energy by unplugging:\n\n*   Small appliances\n    \n*   TVs and gaming consoles\n    \n*   Chargers\n    \n*   Holiday lights\n    \n\nThis simple step helps prevent electrical hazards while you’re gone.\n\n* * *\n\n### **Hold Your Mail and Deliveries**\n\nOverflowing mail or stacks of packages outside your door are clear signs you’re not home.  \nOptions include:\n\n*   Placing a USPS mail hold\n    \n*   Using Amazon Locker or package rooms (if available at your property)\n    \n*   Asking a trusted neighbor to pick up deliveries\n    \n\n* * *\n\n### **Avoid Broadcasting Your Travel Plans**\n\nIt’s tempting to share vacation photos in real time, but doing so can unintentionally alert others that your home is empty.  \nTake photos—just wait to post them until you’re back.\n\n* * *\n\n### **Adjust Your Thermostat Responsibly**\n\nIf you’ll be gone for an extended period:\n\n*   Set your thermostat to an energy-efficient but safe temperature\n    \n*   In cold climates, make sure heat stays above the minimum recommended level to prevent frozen pipes\n    \n\n* * *\n\n### **Remove Garbage \u0026 Perishable Food**\n\nBefore leaving, clear your fridge and take out the trash. Nothing welcomes you home like… well, not bad smells.\n\n* * *\n\n### **Secure Valuables**\n\nStore small valuable items—passports, jewelry, important documents—in a secure place. A small lockbox can offer extra peace of mind.\n\n* * *\n\n### **Rely on Your Community**\n\nOne of the best things about multifamily living is having neighbors nearby.  \nConsider:\n\n*   Letting a trusted neighbor know you’ll be gone\n    \n*   Asking them to report anything unusual\n    \n\n* * *\n\n### **Enjoy Your Holiday Season with Confidence**\n\nWith a few thoughtful steps, you can head out for the holidays knowing your apartment is secure.

While that demographic certainly exists, the modern rental landscape is far more diverse than you might expect. At First Commercial Real Estate \u0026 Management, we’ve seen firsthand how the choice to rent appeals to a wide variety of lifestyles and life stages.\n\nHere’s a closer look at the surprising mix of people choosing to rent in today’s market—and why they’re doing it.\n\n### **1\\. Empty Nesters Looking to Simplify**\n\nMany parents find themselves with a large, mostly empty home once their children move out. Rather than continuing to maintain a house that no longer suits their needs, more and more empty nesters are choosing to rent.\n\nRenting offers the freedom to downsize and simplify. There’s no yard to maintain, no roof to replace, and no long-term commitment tying them to a specific location. It’s a smart, stress-free option that lets them enjoy this new chapter of life without being tied down.\n\n* * *\n\n### **2\\. Downsizers Seeking a Fresh Start**\n\nSometimes, less really is more. Whether due to retirement, lifestyle changes, or simply a desire to cut back on space and responsibility, downsizing has become an increasingly popular trend. Renting makes this transition easier by eliminating many of the financial and maintenance burdens that come with homeownership.\n\nPlus, today’s rental properties offer a wide range of modern amenities, making it possible to live comfortably—and stylishly—with less space.\n\n* * *\n\n### **3\\. Travel Enthusiasts and Digital Nomads**\n\nWith remote work on the rise, a growing number of professionals are embracing a more mobile lifestyle. These travel lovers prefer the flexibility of renting so they can pick up and go without worrying about selling a house or managing a mortgage.\n\nFor digital nomads and globetrotters, renting offers the perfect balance: a comfortable place to call home when needed, with the freedom to explore the world on their own terms.\n\n* * *\n\n### **4\\. Newly Single or Recently Divorced**\n\nLife changes happen, and sometimes that means making a new start. For individuals going through a divorce or separation, renting offers a more flexible and less overwhelming transition. It allows them to get their bearings without the pressure of buying a new home right away.\n\nIt’s not just about necessity—it’s about creating a space that feels like their own, quickly and without long-term commitment.\n\n* * *\n\n### **5\\. Career Movers and Temporary Relocators**\n\nWhether it’s a job promotion, a temporary assignment, or testing the waters in a new city, many professionals find that renting is the most practical option during periods of career change. It allows them to settle into a new place quickly while maintaining the ability to adapt as needed.\n\nThis is especially true in dynamic markets like Tulsa, where people often come for short-term projects or growth opportunities.\n\n* * *\n\n### **6\\. Investors and Savvy Savers**\n\nInterestingly, some people who can afford to buy are choosing to rent—on purpose. Why? Because they see renting as a strategic financial move. By renting, they free up capital for investing, business ventures, or saving for something big down the road.\n\nThese renters view housing as a flexible, functional choice—not just a traditional rite of passage.\n\n* * *\n\n### **Renting Is for Everyone—And That’s a Good Thing**\n\nAt First Commercial Real Estate \u0026 Management, we’re proud to serve a wide range of tenants with different backgrounds, goals, and lifestyles. Renting isn’t just a stepping stone anymore—it’s a smart, flexible option that can fit just about anyone’s life.\n\nWhether you’re downsizing, starting over, or simply prioritizing freedom and mobility, there’s a rental solution that fits your needs. And we’re here to help you find it.\n\n* * *\n\n**Looking for your next place to rent in Tulsa?**  \nExplore our available properties or contact our team to learn more about how we can help you find the perfect fit.\n\n[Contact Us](mailto:management@first-commercial.com)\n\nHow Professional Property Management Protects Your Investment\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**September 9, 2025**\n\nOwning property is one of the most reliable ways to build wealth—but simply holding real estate doesn’t guarantee success. The true key to long-term profitability lies in how the property is managed. Professional property management ensures that your investment isn’t just preserved, but strategically positioned to grow in value.\n\n### 1\\. Maximizing Occupancy and Rental Income\n\nA vacant space is a missed opportunity. Property managers know how to market effectively, screen tenants, and maintain strong relationships to keep occupancy rates high. By minimizing downtime between tenants and setting competitive rental rates, management companies help owners get the most out of their investment.\n\n### 2\\. Reducing Risk and Liability\n\nFrom navigating lease agreements to ensuring compliance with local, state, and federal regulations, property managers protect owners from costly legal missteps. They also handle tenant disputes, collections, and evictions professionally—reducing exposure to liability and stress.\n\n### 3\\. Protecting the Physical Asset\n\nYour property is only as valuable as its condition. Management teams oversee regular maintenance, vendor contracts, and capital improvements, ensuring the building remains attractive and functional. This proactive approach prevents small issues from becoming expensive problems down the road.\n\n### 4\\. Financial Oversight and Transparency\n\nProfessional managers provide clear, detailed financial reporting. From rent collection to budgeting and forecasting, owners gain peace of mind knowing their investment is tracked with accuracy and accountability.\n\n### 5\\. Long-Term Asset Performance\n\nThe best management companies don’t just handle the day-to-day—they plan for the future. With market knowledge and strategic insight, they identify opportunities to increase value, whether through renovations, repositioning, or improved operations.\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nProperty management is more than convenience—it’s protection. A professional management partner safeguards your asset, enhances returns, and ensures your property remains competitive in a changing market. For owners, that means less worry and more confidence that their investment is working for them.\n\n[Contact Us](mailto:management@first-commercial.com)\n\nWhat Are Rent Concessions and Why Are They Beneficial?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n**September 2, 2025**\n\nIf you’ve been searching for an apartment, you may have come across the term **“rent concession.”** But what exactly does that mean, and how can it benefit both renters and property owners?\n\n### What Are Rent Concessions?\n\nA **rent concession** is an incentive offered by a landlord or property management company to attract new tenants or encourage current residents to renew their lease. Concessions typically involve temporary discounts or perks that make leasing more appealing.\n\nCommon types of rent concessions include:\n\n*   **Reduced Rent:** For example, “First month free” or “$200 off your first three months.”\n    \n*   **Waived Fees:** Application, parking, or amenity fees may be temporarily eliminated.\n    \n*   **Added Perks:** Free upgrades, gift cards, or additional amenities at no extra cost.\n    \n\n### Why Rent Concessions Are Beneficial\n\n### For Renters:\n\n*   **Immediate Savings:** Concessions can lower move-in costs, which is especially helpful during times when money is tight.\n    \n*   **Flexibility:** Short-term discounts allow renters to experience a new community without a long-term financial strain.\n    \n*   **Access to Better Housing:** Incentives may open the door to communities or apartments that might otherwise be out of budget.\n    \n\n### For Property Owners \u0026 Managers:\n\n*   **Attract New Residents Quickly:** Offering a concession makes a property stand out in a competitive market.\n    \n*   **Reduce Vacancy Rates:** The faster units are filled, the less income is lost.\n    \n*   **Encourage Renewals:** A well-timed concession can help retain happy residents.\n    \n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nRent concessions can be a win-win: renters enjoy cost savings and perks, while property owners benefit from lower vacancies and satisfied residents. Whether it’s a discount on rent, waived fees, or a unique perk, these incentives create added value and make leasing more attractive.\n\nIf you’re in the market for a new place, keep an eye out for rent concessions—they might just help you land the perfect home at the perfect price.\n\n[Contact Us](mailto:management@first-commercial.com)\n\nWhat First-Time Multifamily Investors Should Know\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n**August 18, 2025**\n\nInvesting in multifamily properties — whether it’s a small apartment building or a larger community — can be an exciting way to grow wealth, generate steady income, and diversify your portfolio. But like any investment, it comes with its own learning curve. If you’re considering your first step into multifamily real estate, here are some key things you should know.\n\n### 1\\. Understand the Appeal of Multifamily Investments\n\nUnlike single-family rentals, multifamily properties provide multiple streams of income under one roof. Even if one unit is vacant, the others can continue generating revenue. Multifamily properties also tend to appreciate steadily and may offer tax advantages that make them especially attractive to long-term investors.\n\n* * *\n\n### 2\\. Financing is Different Than Single-Family\n\nWhile many first-time investors are familiar with conventional home loans, multifamily properties often require different financing structures. For smaller properties (2–4 units), you may still be able to use a residential loan. Larger properties (5+ units) usually involve commercial financing, with stricter requirements for down payments, reserves, and borrower experience. It’s important to connect with a lender who specializes in multifamily lending early in the process.\n\n* * *\n\n### 3\\. Location Matters More Than You Think\n\nA multifamily property’s success hinges on its location. Look for areas with strong rental demand, job growth, and access to amenities like schools, retail, and transportation. A great building in the wrong neighborhood won’t perform as well as a modest property in a thriving area.\n\n* * *\n\n### 4\\. Know Your Numbers\n\nSuccessful multifamily investing is all about the math. Before making an offer, you’ll want to analyze:\n\n*   **Net Operating Income (NOI):** Revenue minus operating expenses.\n    \n*   **Cap Rate:** A measure of the property’s potential return.\n    \n*   **Cash-on-Cash Return:** How much income you’re earning compared to the cash you invested.\n    \n*   **Vacancy Rates \u0026 Rent Growth:** Local market data that impacts long-term performance.\n    \n\n* * *\n\n### 5\\. Property Management Can Make or Break You\n\nMultifamily properties require consistent oversight — from leasing and maintenance to tenant relations and compliance. Many first-time investors underestimate the time commitment. Partnering with an experienced property management company can protect your investment, keep residents satisfied, and free you up to focus on strategy instead of daily operations.\n\n* * *\n\n### 6\\. Expect the Unexpected\n\nVacancies, maintenance surprises, and market shifts are part of the investment landscape. Smart investors plan ahead by setting aside reserves for repairs and turnover, ensuring they aren’t caught off guard by unexpected expenses.\n\n* * *\n\n### 7\\. Think Long-Term\n\nMultifamily properties are rarely a “get-rich-quick” investment. Wealth is typically built over time, through consistent cash flow, gradual rent increases, and property appreciation. Going in with a long-term mindset will help you weather short-term challenges and stay focused on your financial goals.\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nMultifamily investing can be a rewarding path to financial independence, but first-time investors should take the time to educate themselves, build a strong team of advisors, and choose their property wisely. With the right preparation and support, your first multifamily investment can be the foundation of a successful real estate portfolio.\n\nAt **First Commercial Real Estate \u0026 Management**, we specialize in helping investors succeed at every stage — from pre-acquisition analysis and financing strategies to full-service property management and eventual sale. If you’re ready to take the next step in multifamily investing, **don’t go it alone — partner with experts who know how to maximize your returns and protect your investment.**\n\n**Contact us today to schedule a consultation** and let’s build your multifamily investment future together.\n\n[Contact Us](mailto:management@first-commercial.com)\n\nThe Value of Full-Cycle Multifamily Management: From Acquisition to Sale\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**August 4, 2025**\n\nInvesting in multifamily properties can be highly rewarding—but it’s also complex. From identifying the right asset to maximizing its performance and eventually exiting at the right time, each stage requires specialized expertise. Partnering with a company that manages the entire process—from pre-acquisition through management and eventual sale—offers significant advantages.\n\n### 1\\. **Smarter Acquisitions Through Market Insight**\n\nA full-cycle firm doesn’t just find you a property; they analyze it with long-term success in mind. They bring data-driven insights into market trends, rent growth potential, and property performance, helping you avoid costly mistakes and select assets that align with your financial goals.\n\n### 2\\. **Seamless Transition Into Operations**\n\nWhen the same team that helped you acquire the property also manages it, there’s no learning curve. They understand the investment thesis from day one, ensuring the management strategy aligns with your original vision—whether that means value-add renovations, operational efficiencies, or stabilized cash flow.\n\n### 3\\. **Optimized Property Performance**\n\nA company with integrated services can actively monitor performance metrics and adjust strategies quickly. They’re incentivized to maximize net operating income because they know strong operations will lead to a stronger sale when the time comes.\n\n### 4\\. **Strategic Capital Improvements**\n\nWith a clear view of the entire lifecycle, these firms prioritize improvements that not only enhance day-to-day operations but also boost long-term asset value. This ensures every dollar spent is an investment in your eventual exit strategy.\n\n### 5\\. **Streamlined Exit Planning**\n\nWhen it’s time to sell, a full-cycle company already knows the property inside and out. They can position it to attract the right buyers, provide accurate financials, and highlight value enhancements made during ownership—all of which can drive a higher sales price.\n\n### 6\\. **One Relationship, Complete Accountability**\n\nPerhaps the greatest benefit is simplicity. Working with one partner for the entire lifecycle means fewer handoffs, less miscommunication, and one party fully accountable for the success of the investment from start to finish.\n\n[Contact Us](mailto:management@first-commercial.com)\n\nThe Key to Resident Retention: Building Communities, Not Just Managing Properties\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**July 16, 2025**\n\nIn the multifamily housing industry, success isn’t just about filling units—it’s about keeping good residents happy, engaged, and wanting to stay year after year. At **First Commercial Multifamily Management**, we believe resident retention is the heartbeat of a healthy, thriving community.\n\nWhy does retention matter? It’s simple:  \n✔️ Lower turnover means reduced vacancy costs and marketing expenses  \n✔️ Long-term residents contribute to a stronger sense of community  \n✔️ Happy residents are your best source of referrals\n\nBut keeping residents isn’t just about renewals—it’s about relationships.\n\nRelationships Build Retention\n\nGreat resident experiences start with strong communication and a genuine commitment to service. Residents want to feel heard, valued, and part of a community—not just like a leaseholder on a spreadsheet.\n\n**Here’s how we make that happen:**\n\n*   **Prompt, Professional Service** – Quick response times for maintenance and clear communication create trust and satisfaction.\n    \n*   **Consistent Communication** – From newsletters to timely updates, staying connected helps residents feel informed and appreciated.\n    \n*   **Community Engagement** – Events, welcome gifts, or even small gestures can build a sense of belonging.\n    \n*   **Respectful Conflict Resolution** – Addressing concerns fairly and proactively shows residents that their well-being matters.\n    \n\n* * *\n\n### 🛠️ Maintenance Matters\n\nNothing impacts resident satisfaction faster than unresolved maintenance issues. Responsive service requests and proactive maintenance are key drivers of retention—and a major reason why residents choose to renew.\n\nWe focus on:  \n✅ Timely service request responses  \n✅ Preventative maintenance programs  \n✅ Transparent updates on larger projects\n\n* * *\n\n### 💬 Renewal Conversations Are Opportunities\n\nWhen it’s time for lease renewal, it’s not just a transaction—it’s a touchpoint for feedback, appreciation, and genuine conversation. Renewal discussions should be resident-centered, with attention to their experience, concerns, and future plans.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🌟 At First Commercial, Retention Is a Priority\n\nOur commitment goes beyond property management. We strive to create environments where residents feel at home—and that’s why so many of our residents choose to stay year after year.\n\nWhen we build stronger communities, retention naturally follows.\n\n* * *\n\n**Ready to experience the First Commercial difference?**  \nContact us today to learn how we combine exceptional service with community-first management.\n\n[Contact Us](mailto:management@first-commercial.com)\n\nStewards of Community: How HOA Property Managers Lead Through Communication\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJuly 7, 2025\n\nIn today’s fast-paced world, Homeowners Associations (HOAs) play a vital role in maintaining the quality, safety, and value of residential communities. But behind every well-kept neighborhood and every smoothly run board meeting stands a key figure: the **HOA property manager**.\n\nMore than just operational coordinators, HOA property managers serve as **stewards of the communities** they oversee. They wear many hats—administrator, mediator, advisor, and communicator—and their success hinges on one critical skill: **effective communication.**\n\n### 📬 The Role of a Steward\n\nBeing a steward means more than just managing tasks—it means taking responsibility for the long-term well-being of the community. A great HOA property manager helps:\n\n*   Maintain common areas and assets\n    \n*   Support the board in enforcing rules and covenants\n    \n*   Ensure vendors and service providers are delivering quality work\n    \n*   Assist with budgeting, collections, and financial reporting\n    \n*   Guide the board through legal and procedural matters\n    \n\nAll of these duties, when done well, build trust with homeowners, protect property values, and enhance community living.\n\n* * *\n\n### 💬 Communication: The Cornerstone of Stewardship\n\nEven the most capable property manager can’t succeed without **clear, timely, and transparent communication**. Here’s why it matters so much:\n\n#### 1\\. **Builds Trust with Residents**\n\nWhether it’s a maintenance update or a reminder about community rules, open communication helps residents feel informed and respected. A well-informed homeowner is more likely to be a cooperative one.\n\n#### 2\\. **Keeps the Board Empowered**\n\nHOA boards rely on property managers for accurate data, timely reports, and professional guidance. Regular updates and honest dialogue allow board members to make better decisions and stay aligned with community goals.\n\n#### 3\\. **Defuses Conflict**\n\nConflicts can and do arise—between neighbors, board members, or regarding enforcement issues. A skilled communicator can listen, clarify misunderstandings, and offer fair, policy-based solutions before issues escalate.\n\n#### 4\\. **Increases Engagement**\n\nA connected community is a stronger one. When residents receive regular newsletters, alerts, or invitations to participate, it encourages involvement and pride in the neighborhood.\n\n* * *\n\n### 📱 Modern Tools for Modern Managers\n\nEffective communication today also means using the right tools. HOA property managers who embrace platforms like **AppFolio**, **email portals**, **SMS alerts**, or **community forums** can streamline information sharing and improve responsiveness.\n\nPairing modern tech with a human approach—being accessible, approachable, and empathetic—creates the winning formula for lasting community trust.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧭 Final Thought: Leadership Through Service\n\nAt its heart, HOA property management is about **servant leadership**. The best managers don’t just “run” a community—they **serve** it, **advocate** for it, and help it thrive. \n\n[Contact Us](mailto:management@first-commercial.com)\n\nstate of the multifamily market: first half of 2025\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nJune 17, 2025\n\nDemand \u003e Supply = Rents rising! \n\nQ1 2025: absorption highest since ’85, vacancy at ~4.8%, investor interest surging.

From falsified rental applications to stolen mail and data breaches, apartment communities are increasingly vulnerable to fraudsters who exploit both digital and physical vulnerabilities.**\n\n**Understanding how identity theft occurs in multifamily settings—and knowing how to respond—can help protect residents, management teams, and the integrity of your property.**\n\n🕵️‍♂️ How Identity Theft Happens in Multifamily Communities\n\n**1\\.

Unfortunately, that’s not the case. A landlord’s policy typically only covers the building itself—not your personal belongings, liability, or temporary living expenses if disaster strikes.\n\nThat’s where **renters insurance** comes in.\n\n### 🏠 What Is Renters Insurance?\n\nRenters insurance is a policy that protects your personal property and offers liability coverage while you’re renting a home or apartment. For a small monthly premium—usually between $10 and $25—you gain peace of mind and financial protection.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🔒 What Does It Cover?\n\nMost standard policies include:\n\n**1\\. Personal Property Protection**  \nIf your belongings are damaged or stolen due to events like fire, theft, vandalism, or certain types of water damage, renters insurance helps you replace them.\n\n**2\\. Liability Coverage**  \nIf someone is injured in your unit or you accidentally damage another person’s property (like a leak that damages your neighbor’s ceiling), this coverage can help pay for legal and medical costs.\n\n**3\\. Additional Living Expenses (ALE)**  \nIf your apartment becomes uninhabitable due to a covered event, your policy may pay for hotel stays, food, and other costs while you’re temporarily displaced.\n\n* * *\n\n### 💸 Why It’s Worth Every Penny\n\n**It’s affordable** – For less than the cost of a streaming subscription, you can protect thousands of dollars’ worth of personal property.\n\n**It can save you from major out-of-pocket expenses** – Without coverage, you’d have to replace everything you own on your own, not to mention pay for alternative housing in an emergency.\n\n**It helps protect your future** – Having renters insurance and filing claims responsibly can positively affect your insurance history, potentially lowering premiums for future homeowners or auto policies.\n\n* * *\n\n### 🧾 Renters Insurance \u0026 Your Lease\n\nSome apartment communities require renters insurance as part of the lease agreement, and for good reason: it helps protect both you and the property. Even if it’s not mandatory, it’s still highly recommended as part of being a responsible resident.\n\n* * *\n\n### ✅ How to Get Started\n\n*   Shop around: Compare quotes from reputable providers.\n    \n*   Know what you need: Take an inventory of your belongings.\n    \n*   Understand your policy: Make sure it covers the types of risks most likely to affect you (like floods, if you’re in a flood-prone area).\n    \n\n* * *\n\n### Final Thought\n\nAccidents and disasters are unpredictable—but your financial well-being doesn’t have to be. Renters insurance is a small investment with big benefits. Whether you’re in a studio apartment or a three-bedroom rental, it’s one of the easiest ways to protect yourself, your belongings, and your peace of mind.\n\n[Contact Us](mailto:management@first-commercial.com)\n\nStorm \u0026 Severe Weather Safety: A Guide for Apartment Living\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMay 19, 2025\n\nWhether it’s tornado season in Oklahoma, heavy thunderstorms, or unexpected winter storms, it’s crucial to be prepared—and to know what actions to take when weather turns dangerous.\n\nHere’s how apartment residents can stay safe and informed when storms strike:\n\n### 🌪️ **1\\.

Even unintentional discrimination—such as writing a rental ad that includes phrasing like “perfect for singles”—can be considered a violation. It’s your responsibility as a landlord or property manager to treat all prospective and current tenants equally and fairly.\n\n### **Best Practices for Compliance**\n\nTo stay in compliance and foster an inclusive rental environment, follow these guidelines:\n\n#### 1\\. **Standardize Your Screening Process**\n\nUse the same criteria for all applicants, such as income-to-rent ratio, credit score, background checks, and rental history. Avoid subjective language like “gut feeling.”\n\n#### 2\\. **Be Careful with Advertising**\n\nYour rental listings should focus on the property, not the type of tenant you’re looking for. Avoid phrases that suggest preference, such as “ideal for young couples” or “no kids.”\n\n#### 3\\. **Provide Reasonable Accommodations**\n\nIf a tenant has a disability, be prepared to make reasonable modifications or accommodations, such as allowing a service animal even if you have a no-pets policy.\n\n#### 4\\. **Train Your Staff**\n\nIf you work with a team, make sure everyone involved in leasing or property management is trained on Fair Housing Laws and understands how to avoid discrimination—intentional or not.\n\n#### 5\\. **Document Everything**\n\nKeep written records of interactions with applicants and tenants, especially decisions about applications or lease terminations. Clear documentation can help protect you if questions arise.\n\n### **Work With Professionals**\n\nPartnering with a knowledgeable property management company like First Commercial can make a big difference in maintaining compliance.

Good tenants pay rent on time, take care of the property, and contribute to a positive community atmosphere. Here’s how First Commercial works with Owners to attract and retain reliable renters. \n\n*   Enhance Curb Appeal\n*   Offer Competitive Rental Rates\n*   Market the Property Effectively\n*   Screen Tenants Thoroughly\n*   Maintain the Property Proactively\n\n*   Build Strong Tenant Relationships\n*   Offer Flexible Lease Terms\n*   Ensure a Safe Environment\n*   Provide Amenities\n*   Encourage a Community Atmosphere\n\n1.  ### 1\\. **Enhance Curb Appeal**\n    \n    First impressions matter. A well-maintained exterior, clean common areas, and attractive landscaping can make a property more inviting. Investing in regular upkeep signals to potential tenants that the property is well-managed. First Commercial has an excellent vendor list and maintenance staff who can help keep your property looking its best. \n    \n    ### 2\\. **Offer Competitive Rental Rates**\n    \n    Researching the local market ensures that your rental rates are fair and competitive. Overpricing can drive away potential tenants, while underpricing may attract less qualified renters or reduce profitability. If you hire professional management, it’s important to go with a company who is in the local market and knows the area and its trends.\n    \n    ### 3\\. **Market the Property Effectively**\n    \n    Use high-quality photos, virtual tours, and detailed descriptions in online listings. Leverage social media, rental websites, and local advertising to reach a broader audience. Highlight unique features, such as updated appliances, security features, or included utilities.\n    \n    ### 4\\. **Screen Tenants Thoroughly**\n    \n    A rigorous screening process helps ensure that tenants are financially responsible and have a history of good rental behavior. We check credit reports, verify employment and income, and contact previous landlords to assess reliability.\n    \n    ### 5\\. **Maintain the Property Proactively**\n    \n    Responsive maintenance is key to tenant satisfaction. Regular inspections, quick repairs, and upgrades (such as energy-efficient appliances) help retain tenants and demonstrate a commitment to their comfort.\n    \n    ### 6\\. **Build Strong Tenant Relationships**\n    \n    Good communication fosters a positive landlord-tenant relationship. Being approachable, addressing concerns promptly, and showing appreciation—such as offering lease renewal incentives—can encourage long-term tenancy.\n    \n    ### 7\\. **Offer Flexible Lease Terms**\n    \n    Providing different lease options (e.g., 12-month vs. 24-month leases) can attract a wider range of renters. Consider offering incentives like discounted rent for longer commitments.\n    \n    ### 8\\. **Ensure a Safe and Secure Environment**\n    \n    Safety is a top priority for tenants. Installing security cameras, proper lighting, and secure locks can enhance tenant confidence in their living environment.\n    \n    ### 9\\. **Provide Modern Amenities**\n    \n    High-speed internet, smart home features, laundry facilities, and energy-efficient appliances are attractive perks that can set your property apart from competitors.\n    \n    ### 10\\. **Encourage a Community Atmosphere**\n    \n    Creating a sense of community can increase tenant satisfaction and retention. Hosting resident events, implementing referral programs, and maintaining open communication channels can foster a friendly and welcoming environment.\n    \n    By following these strategies, property owners can attract reliable tenants and encourage long-term residency, ultimately leading to increased profitability and a more stable rental business.
