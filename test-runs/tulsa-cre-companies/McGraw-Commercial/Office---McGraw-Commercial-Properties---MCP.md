### Capitalizing on the ever-changing office market dynamics

[Let's Talk](https://www.mcgrawcp.com/contact)

#### For Landlords

Every property has its own unique traits and attributes which form its story.  We help you tell your story by leveraging our creative marketing strategies and deep local market expertise to highlight your property’s strengths. We understand emerging market trends and changing occupier needs and we position your property to attract tenants while achieving optimal rents that maximize building value.

#### For Tenants

Your leased space is an extension of your company’s brand which can influence customer perception and support employee performance and retention. We assist occupiers in making complex real estate decisions regarding their leased space. Our process begins with the evaluation of space requirements, identification of cost reductions, and identification of the tenant improvements cost, leading to an evaluation of the benefits of a renewal vs. relocation and nuanced lease negotiations. Our tenant leasing professionals support the goals of our occupier clients throughout the process, providing valuable insights and advice.

### Hear from Our Clients

“I reached out to Julie with MCP several months ago with a proposition to sell a large building I had in Collinsville and **Julie and her team jumped into action**. We got pictures and went over options and before I knew it, we had prospective buyers making offers. Julie with **MCP will get the job done**. Julie was able to get what we were looking for on this particular piece of property and get it closed very quickly. I highly recommend her and the MCP team if you are looking to sell your commercial property.”

### Hear from Our Clients

“We were in a rush to find a property, and McGraw showed us properties, answered questions, and coordinated between us and the property management. They listened to us and **didn’t waste our time** by showing us properties that were unsuitable in space and/or budget. **I recommend the McGraw team without hesitation!**”
