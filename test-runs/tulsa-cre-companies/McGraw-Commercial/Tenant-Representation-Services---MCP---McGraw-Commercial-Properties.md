There are so many industry-related terms and market details that it is almost impossible for someone not actively involved with real estate to know everything. MCP is committed to finding and completing a lease at the best property for you, providing unbiased advice and advocacy during the leasing process.

MCP Delivers Comprehensive Solutions
------------------------------------

Not all real estate is created equal, and the space you choose for your organization can profoundly impact your business. At MCP, we take time to learn about your company and create long-term, comprehensive strategies that combine financial, business, and real estate objectives.

If you’re facing any of these challenging questions that many tenants have in common, we can help:

When a lease expiration is on the horizon, is renewing the best option? If so, what terms should be expected?

Should you consider moving to another market or submarket?

What are the pros and cons of owning versus leasing? Does a property acquisition best suit your needs?

When is subleasing space the best option? What are the benefits and risks?

Does a sale-leaseback transaction make sense?

If you are starting a new company, what is the right amount of space for your organization? Where is the best location based on your priorities?

If expansion is the next step, is space available at your current location? Are there more attractive alternatives?

If space consolidation is the best choice, how do you right-size most beneficially?
