### Hear from Our Clients

“Dick brought **years of valuable experience** in finding my newest HTeaO location. I do not need help finding sites that are already for sale. What I needed was someone to call and find unlisted properties that no one else might have thought about. He did just that, and we will be opening a new store in Claremore soon. I appreciate the work he did for us.”

#### Hear from Our Clients

“I referred a client to Julie from Kansas City and at first glance, the sale appeared to be fairly straightforward. Due to unforeseen circumstances, the transaction became very difficult, but that did not deter Julie from **finding a solution for both parties** in order to get the transaction closed. Despite everything thrown at her, she had an incredible attitude and professionalism that **brought the parties together**.”
