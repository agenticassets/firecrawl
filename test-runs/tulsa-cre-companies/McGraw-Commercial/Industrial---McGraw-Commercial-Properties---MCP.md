### Hear from Our Clients

“My company was ready to move from one location to another. The McGraw team **worked hard on the behalf of my company**, and all the rest fell into place. He made sure **we got the 'best bang' for our buck**. The new facility was put in 'tip top' shape and we actually moved in on time with a **well-negotiated price**.”

### Hear from Our Clients

“We have worked with Gary Krisman and the McGraw team for many years across several different transactions. While there is much to like about working on transactions with McGraw, more than anything we appreciate that **we can fully depend on any data or analysis provided**. Like any broker, they need deals to close to make their money, but **we have never seen them sacrifice their integrity and relationships** for the sake of getting a deal done.”

### Hear from Our Clients

“Dick brought **years of valuable experience** in finding my newest HTeaO location. I do not need help finding sites that are already for sale. What I needed was someone to call and find unlisted properties that no one else might have thought about. He did just that, and we will be opening a new store in Claremore soon. I appreciate the work he did for us.”
