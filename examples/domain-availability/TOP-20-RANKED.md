|--------|--------|-------------|
| 40% | **Finance/CRE resonance** | Root word evokes capital, equity, value, trust, credit, leverage, or CRE concepts |

### Team Style Profile (derived from favorites)

The team gravitates toward: Latin roots, finance-semantic prefixes (`cap-`, `eq-`, `val-`, `evid-`), professional suffixes (`-or`, `-ir`, `-irr`), and 5-letter names with strong consonant structure. The ideal name sounds like it could be a subsidiary of Goldman Sachs or a module on a Bloomberg terminal.

## The Top 20

### 1. aequi.ai

**Score: 98** | 5 letters | Latin root

The Latin root of "equity" itself. *Aequitas* (fairness, equity) is the foundational concept of finance. This name carries 2,000 years of legal and financial meaning. Pronounce: **AY-kwee**. It sounds scholarly and authoritative without being obscure. Any finance professional will feel the connection to "equity" immediately, even if they don't know Latin. This is the single most semantically powerful available name in the entire pool.

**Why #1**: Maximum finance resonance + perfect length + timeless institutional feel.

---

### 2. ebit.ai

**Score: 95** | 4 letters | Finance acronym

EBIT = Earnings Before Interest and Taxes. This is an actual, universally-known financial metric used in every CRE underwriting model, PE deal memo, and quarterly earnings report. At only 4 letters, it's the shortest name on this list. Every finance professional already knows and uses this word daily. The `.ai` extension turns a metric into a brand: "EBIT.ai - the AI that understands your financials."

**Why #2**: Shortest name + universally recognized finance term + instant credibility.

---

### 3. levir.ai

**Score: 93** | 5 letters | Finance concept

"Leverage" is the defining mechanism of private equity and CRE finance. The entire PE/CRE business model is built on leverage - using debt to amplify equity returns. This name captures that core concept in 5 letters with a strong `-ir` ending the team favors. Pronounce: **LEH-vir**. Sounds like a Latin agent noun ("one who leverages").

**Why #3**: PE's core concept + team-preferred suffix pattern + clean phonetics.

---

### 4. amort.ai

**Score: 91** | 5 letters | Finance concept

Amortization is a daily-use term in CRE finance: loan amortization schedules, cap rate decomposition, depreciation. Every CRE analyst builds amortization tables. The name is immediately recognizable to any finance professional and the truncation feels modern, like how "quant" comes from "quantitative." Pronounce: **ah-MORT**.

**Why #4**: Core CRE concept + high recognition + natural abbreviation feel.

---

### 5. lucri.ai

**Score: 89** | 5 letters | Latin root

Latin genitive of *lucrum* (profit, gain). "Lucrative" derives from this root. The name says "of profit" - which is exactly what a PE/CRE AI tool delivers. Pronounce: **LOO-kree**. Elegant, scholarly, and the finance meaning is transparent to English speakers through "lucrative."

**Why #5**: Direct profit semantics + Latin elegance + transparent etymology.

---

### 6. creor.ai

**Score: 87** | 5 letters | Finance root

"Credit" is the lifeblood of CRE. This name combines the `cre-` root (credit, credibility) with `-or` (Latin agent suffix = "one who"). Sounds like a Latin word meaning "one who gives credit/trust." Pronounce: **KREE-or**. Clean, professional, zero ambiguity.

**Why #6**: Credit is foundational to CRE + strong Latin structure + team-preferred `-or` ending.

---

### 7. cairr.ai

**Score: 86** | 5 letters | Finance portmanteau

Read it as **C + IRR**: Capital + Internal Rate of Return. These are arguably the two most important concepts in PE/CRE investing. IRR is THE metric by which PE performance is measured. The double-r matches the team's stated preference (valirr, capirr, vectirr). Pronounce: **KAIR** (rhymes with "care"). Short, punchy, and finance insiders will appreciate the embedded meaning.

**Why #7**: Embeds two core PE metrics + double-r team preference + memorable.

---

### 8. tenax.ai

**Score: 84** | 5 letters | Latin word

Latin for "holding firm, tenacious." In CRE, *tenancy* and *tenure* are fundamental - tenant quality drives property value. The `-ax` ending is sharp and memorable (think "Xerox," "Ajax"). This is a real Latin word, not a fabrication, which gives it authenticity. Pronounce: **TEH-nax**.

**Why #8**: Real estate semantics (tenancy) + real Latin word + strong phonetics.

---

### 9. fidin.ai

**Score: 82** | 5 letters | Finance concept

From "fiduciary" - the highest legal standard of care in finance. Institutional investors operate under fiduciary duty. This name signals trust, responsibility, and institutional-grade rigor. Pronounce: **FID-in**. Short, clean, immediately evokes the right associations.

**Why #9**: Fiduciary duty = institutional finance cornerstone + clean 5-letter form.

---

### 10. prael.ai

**Score: 80** | 5 letters | Latin prefix

Latin *prae-* means "before, ahead of." Evokes foresight, proactive analysis, and being ahead of the market - exactly what an AI tool promises. Has the feel of a high-end consulting firm name. Pronounce: **PRAY-el**. Distinctive without being difficult.

**Why #10**: Foresight/proactive semantics + elegant sound + consulting-firm gravitas.

---

### 11. equir.ai

**Score: 79** | 5 letters | Finance root

"Equity" + team-preferred `-ir` ending. The most direct equity reference after `aequi.ai`. Pronounce: **EH-kwir** (like "inquire" without the "n"). Very close in style to team favorites eqin.ai and equor.ai.

**Why #11**: Direct equity reference + team-style suffix + phonetically clean.

---

### 12. vairr.ai

**Score: 78** | 5 letters | Finance portmanteau

"Value" + "IRR" - two pillars of CRE/PE analysis. Value creation measured by IRR is the fundamental PE equation. The double-r matches team preference. Pronounce: **VAIR** (like "fair" with a V). Simple and strong.

**Why #12**: Embeds value + IRR + double-r preference + one-syllable simplicity.

---

### 13. rexir.ai

**Score: 76** | 5 letters | Latin root

*Rex* = king, authority. Combined with `-ir` suffix. Conveys dominance and authority in the market. Pronounce: **REX-ir**. Has a commanding presence that suits institutional finance. Think "the king of analysis."

**Why #13**: Authority semantics + strong phonetics + team-preferred suffix.

---

### 14. videre.ai

**Score: 75** | 6 letters | Latin word

Latin infinitive "to see." Due diligence is about *seeing* clearly - seeing risk, seeing value, seeing what others miss. This is a real, beautiful Latin word. Pronounce: **vih-DAIR-eh**. Slightly longer at 6 letters but the meaning is powerful and the word is elegant.

**Why #14**: "To see" = due diligence + evidence + transparency. Real Latin word.

---

### 15. credor.ai

**Score: 74** | 6 letters | Finance root

Sounds exactly like "creditor" - one who extends credit. CRE is fundamentally about credit: lenders, debt service, credit analysis. At 6 letters it's slightly longer but the finance meaning is unmistakable. Pronounce: **KRED-or**.

**Why #15**: Unmistakable credit/creditor association + institutional sound.

---

### 16. fidur.ai

**Score: 72** | 5 letters | Finance concept

Abbreviated "fiduciary." Where `fidin.ai` captures the beginning, `fidur` captures more of the word's middle. Pronounce: **FID-ur**. Slightly less elegant than `fidin` but still strong.

**Why #16**: Fiduciary reference + 5-letter brevity + professional feel.

---

### 17. bonir.ai

**Score: 70** | 5 letters | Finance root

"Bond" + `-ir` suffix. Bonds (debt instruments) are the backbone of CRE finance - CMBS, muni bonds, corporate debt. Pronounce: **BON-ir**. Clean and direct.

**Why #17**: Debt/bond markets reference + team-preferred suffix + simple.

---

### 18. paritas.ai

**Score: 68** | 7 letters | Latin word

Latin for "equality, fairness, parity." In finance, parity pricing, risk parity, and fair value are core concepts. This is a real Latin word with deep institutional meaning. Pronounce: **pah-REE-tahs**. Longer at 7 letters but the gravitas compensates.

**Why #18**: Deep institutional meaning + real Latin word + fairness/parity concepts.

---

### 19. capor.ai

**Score: 66** | 5 letters | Finance root

"Capital" + `-or` agent suffix. Very similar in pattern to team favorite `capro.ai`. Pronounce: **KAP-or**. Straightforward capital reference.

**Why #19**: Capital root + team-style pattern + clean 5 letters.

---

### 20. valox.ai

**Score: 64** | 5 letters | Finance root

"Value" + `-ox` ending. Modern feel with a strong ending. Pronounce: **VAL-ox**. The `val-` root immediately signals valuation, value-add, and value creation - all PE/CRE vocabulary.

**Why #20**: Value root + modern/sharp ending + brandable.

---
