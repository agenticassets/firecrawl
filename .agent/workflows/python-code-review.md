Debug and enhance Python econometric code by identifying errors and improving functionality, efficiency, and speed.

## Step 1: Error Detection and Debugging
- **Syntax validation**: Check for Python syntax errors and import issues
- **Runtime testing**: Execute scripts to identify runtime exceptions and failures
- **Exception analysis**: Review error messages and traceback information
- **Data validation**: Verify input data integrity and expected formats
- **Implementation completeness**: Verify code is fully implemented without placeholder code, hard-coded data points, or placeholder variables
- **Code quality standards**: Never include emojis in Python code - they can cause execution errors across different environments and platforms

## Step 2: Functionality Enhancement
- **Code refinement**: Improve existing algorithms and data processing logic
- **Feature optimization**: Enhance core functionality and add missing capabilities
- **Logic improvements**: Streamline complex operations and decision flows
- **Output quality**: Improve result accuracy and completeness

## Step 3: Performance Optimization
- **Speed improvements**: Identify and eliminate computational bottlenecks
- **Memory efficiency**: Optimize data structures and memory usage patterns
- **Vectorization**: Convert loops to vectorized pandas/numpy operations
- **I/O optimization**: Improve file operations and data loading efficiency

## Step 4: Testing and Validation
- **Fix verification**: Test that identified errors are resolved
- **Performance benchmarking**: Measure speed and efficiency improvements
- **Regression testing**: Ensure enhancements don't break existing functionality
- **Edge case handling**: Validate behavior with unusual inputs

## Focus Areas
- **Error resolution**: Prioritize fixing runtime errors and exceptions
- **Implementation completeness**: Verify code is fully implemented without placeholder code, hard-coded data points, or placeholder variables
- **Speed gains**: Target operations that can provide significant performance improvements
- **Code clarity**: Simplify complex sections for better maintainability
- **Resource usage**: Reduce memory footprint and computational overhead

## Quick Wins
1. **Critical bugs**: Fix errors preventing script execution
2. **Slow operations**: Optimize data processing bottlenecks
3. **Memory issues**: Reduce excessive memory consumption
4. **Logic flaws**: Correct algorithmic inefficiencies

Debug Python code to eliminate errors, then enhance functionality and optimize performance for faster, more efficient execution.
